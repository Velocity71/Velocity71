Hello. I am Velocity71. I am a self-tought HS programmer. 
I have experience with Java, Python, C++, and shell scripts. 
I am always looking to learn more for fun, and I enjoy creating my own projects, even if they already exist.
I am also a part of a soon-to-be-announced game development team with my friends.
