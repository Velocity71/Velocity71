Hello. I am Parker and I am a self-tought HS programmer.
I have experience in Java, Python, and shell scripts, and I am currently learning C/C++, Rust, and Swift.
I usually code instead of doing my schoolwork because my english and politics classes are boring, and I 
love procrastination on my physics, calculus, and computer science classes.
